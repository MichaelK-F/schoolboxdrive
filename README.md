## Intro
Schoolbox has a generic endpoint where a file is uploaded, then later assigned a
purpose, e.g. to appear under a certain page. The latter step is however not required,
meaning you can simply upload a file and it will stay there indefinitely. This design flaw
hence makes it a perfect storage solution.

## Usage
Open configuration in the application then follow instructions.
